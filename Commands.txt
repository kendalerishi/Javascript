Åcor create a new repository on the command line
echo "# Javascript" >> README.md
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/kendalerishi/Javascript.git
git push -u origin master


5 commands for the first time
From 2nd time onwards for the same folder we use only 3 commands :
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push -u origin master


branching  (newfeature is branch of master) another developer will commit code in newfeature. Then he raise a pull request. If you have deleted any file in newfeature branch and push code and merge to master then from master also that file will be deleted.
git checkout -b newfeature
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push -u origin newfeature





Åcor push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/kendalerishi/Javascript.git
git push -u origin master
